# FreqShield: Rethinking Voice Cloning Defense via Information Subtraction

This repository contains audio samples for the paper "FreqShield: Rethinking Voice Cloning Defense via Information Subtraction".

## Demo Page

ðŸŽµ **Interactive Audio Demo**: Visit our [demo page](URL_TO_BE_FILLED) to listen to and compare audio samples from different TTS models and their protection effects.

## Directory Structure

Each subfolder in the `samples/` directory represents a different TTS (Text-to-Speech) model and contains audio samples generated by that model:

- `cosyvoice2/`
- `f5/`
- `indextts/`
- `minmax/`
- `papla/`
P
Each subfolder contains the following types of files:


### 1. Reference Audio (refer_1, refer_2, refer_3)
- `refer_1.*`: Generated from the text "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." (This sentence contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet.)
- `refer_2.*`: Generated from the text "Twelve tiny twins twirled twelve twigs toward the twisting tower." (This is a tongue twister, chosen for its phonetic complexity.)
- `refer_3.*`: Generated from the text "Despite the initial challenges and numerous setbacks, the team persevered and ultimately achieved a result that exceeded all expectations." (This is a complex, long sentence representing challenging, natural speech.)

### 2. Protected Audio (files starting with 4_950)
- `4_950_*.flac` or `4_950_*.wav`: Audio protected using a 4th-order Butterworth high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 950 Hz.

### 3. Original Audio
- Audio files named after the original file, representing the unprotected original audio.

## Usage

- This repository is intended for academic research and reproduction of the experiments in the paper only. Commercial use is strictly prohibited.
